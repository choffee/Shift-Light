Some arduino software to replace the single puney LED in my shift light with
some tri-colour LEDS doing something useful.

Things I want it to do.
   Talk over USB to the PC
   Allow setting of a number of tri-colour LEDS
   Do some colour cycling by default, or as a screen saver.
   Respond to the key press - Flash lights and tell PC
   Might as well add a temperature sensor.
